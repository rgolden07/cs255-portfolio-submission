Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client was DriverPass and they wanted me to design a web based application to facilitate running their business. 

What did you do particularly well?
I am not quite sure, but hey this is the last assignment so thats got to count for something.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would most likely go back and respond to a few of my fellow classmates in the discussions.  Actually responding at all would be an improvement.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I fell like i interpreted them in a manner that suited the rubric, and its important because they are the customer. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I have no idea I just want to stop writing papers.
